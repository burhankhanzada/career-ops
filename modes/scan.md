# Mode: scan — Portal Scanner (Job Discovery)

Scans configured job portals, filters by title relevance, and adds new offers to the pipeline for later evaluation.

## Recommended Execution

Execute as a subagent to avoid consuming main context:

```
Agent(
    subagent_type="general-purpose",
    prompt="[content of this file + specific data]",
    run_in_background=True
)
```

## Configuration

Read `portals.yml` which contains:
- `search_queries`: List of WebSearch queries with `site:` filters per portal (broad discovery)
- `tracked_companies`: Specific companies with `careers_url` for direct navigation
- `title_filter`: Positive/negative/seniority_boost keywords for title filtering

## Discovery Strategy (3 Levels)

### Level 1 — Direct Playwright (PRIMARY)

**For each company in `tracked_companies`:** Navigate to their `careers_url` with Playwright (`browser_navigate` + `browser_snapshot`), read ALL visible job listings, and extract title + URL for each. This is the most reliable method because:
- Sees the page in real-time (not cached Google results)
- Works with SPAs (Ashby, Lever, Workday)
- Detects new offers instantly
- Does not depend on Google indexing

**Each company MUST have a `careers_url` in portals.yml.** If omitted, search for it once, save it, and use it in future scans.

### Level 2 — ATS APIs / Feeds (COMPLEMENTARY)

For companies with a public API or structured feed, use the JSON/XML response as a fast complement to Level 1. It is faster than Playwright and reduces visual scraping errors.

**Current Support (variables in `{}`):**
- **Greenhouse**: `https://boards-api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{company}/jobs`
- **Ashby**: `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR**: list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; offer detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Lever**: `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor**: `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday**: `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**Parsing Convention by Provider:**
- `greenhouse`: `jobs[]` → `title`, `absolute_url`
- `ashby`: GraphQL `ApiJobBoardWithTeams` with `organizationHostedJobsPageName={company}` → `jobBoard.jobPostings[]` (`title`, `id`; construct public URL if not in payload)
- `bamboohr`: list `result[]` → `jobOpeningName`, `id`; construct detail URL `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`; to read full JD, GET the detail and use `result.jobOpening` (`jobOpeningName`, `description`, `datePosted`, `minimumExperience`, `compensation`, `jobOpeningShareUrl`)
- `lever`: root array `[]` → `text`, `hostedUrl` (fallback: `applyUrl`)
- `teamtailor`: RSS items → `title`, `link`
- `workday`: `jobPostings[]`/`jobPostings` (per tenant) → `title`, `externalPath` or constructed URL from host

### Level 3 — WebSearch Queries (BROAD DISCOVERY)

`search_queries` with `site:` filters cover portals transversally (all Ashby, all Greenhouse, etc.). Useful for discovering NEW companies not yet in `tracked_companies`, but results may be outdated.

**Execution Priority:**
1. Level 1: Playwright → all `tracked_companies` with `careers_url`
2. Level 2: API → all `tracked_companies` with `api:`
3. Level 3: WebSearch → all `search_queries` with `enabled: true`

Levels are additive — all are executed, results are merged and deduplicated.

## Workflow

1. **Read Configuration**: `portals.yml`
2. **Read History**: `data/scan-history.tsv` → already seen URLs
3. **Read Dedup Sources**: `data/applications.md` + `data/pipeline.md`

4. **Level 1 — Playwright Scan** (parallel in batches of 3-5):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with `enabled: true` and defined `careers_url`:
   a. `browser_navigate` to `careers_url`
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read all job listings
   c. If the page has filters/departments, navigate relevant sections
   d. For each job listing extract: `{title, url, company}`
   e. If the page uses pagination, navigate additional pages
   f. Accumulate in candidate list
   g. If `careers_url` fails (404, redirect), try `scan_query` as fallback and note to update the URL

5. **Level 2 — ATS APIs / Feeds** (parallel):
   For each company in `tracked_companies` with defined `api:` and `enabled: true`:
   a. WebFetch the API/feed URL
   b. If `api_provider` is defined, use its parser; if not, infer by domain (`boards-api.greenhouse.io`, `jobs.ashbyhq.com`, `api.lever.co`, `*.bamboohr.com`, `*.teamtailor.com`, `*.myworkdayjobs.com`)
   c. For **Ashby**, send POST with:
      - `operationName: ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
      - `variables.organizationHostedJobsPageName: {company}`
      - GraphQL query for `jobBoardWithTeams` + `jobPostings { id title locationName employmentType compensationTierSummary }`
   d. For **BambooHR**, the list only brings basic metadata. For each relevant item, read `id`, GET `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`, and extract the full JD from `result.jobOpening`. Use `jobOpeningShareUrl` as public URL if present; else, use detail URL.
   e. For **Workday**, send POST JSON with at least `{"appliedFacets":{},"limit":20,"offset":0,"searchText":""}` and paginate by `offset` until results are exhausted
   f. For each job extract and normalize: `{title, url, company}`
   g. Accumulate in candidate list (dedup with Level 1)

6. **Level 3 — WebSearch Queries** (parallel if possible):
   For each query in `search_queries` with `enabled: true`:
   a. Execute WebSearch with defined `query`
   b. From each result extract: `{title, url, company}`
      - **title**: from results title (before " @ " or " | ")
      - **url**: result URL
      - **company**: after " @ " in title, or extract from domain/path
   c. Accumulate in candidate list (dedup with Level 1+2)

7. **Filter by Title** using `title_filter` from `portals.yml`:
   - At least 1 `positive` keyword must appear in the title (case-insensitive)
   - 0 `negative` keywords must appear
   - `seniority_boost` keywords give priority but are not mandatory

8. **Deduplicate** against 3 sources:
   - `scan-history.tsv` → exact URL already seen
   - `applications.md` → company + normalized role already evaluated
   - `pipeline.md` → exact URL already in pending or processed

9. **Verify Liveness of Level 3 Results** — BEFORE adding to pipeline:

   WebSearch results can be outdated (Google caches results for weeks). To avoid evaluating expired offers, verify every new Level 3 URL with Playwright. Levels 1 and 2 are real-time and do not require this.

   For each new Level 3 URL (sequential — NEVER parallel Playwright):
   a. `browser_navigate` to URL
   b. `browser_snapshot` to read content
   c. Classify:
      - **Active**: job title visible + role description + visible Apply/Submit button in main content. Do not count generic header/navbar/footer text.
      - **Expired** (any of these signals):
        - Final URL contains `?error=true` (Greenhouse redirects here when offer is closed)
        - Page contains: "job no longer available" / "no longer open" / "position has been filled" / "this job has expired" / "page not found"
        - Only navbar and footer visible, no JD content (content < ~300 chars)
   d. If expired: register in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_expired` and discard
   e. If active: proceed to step 10

   **Do not interrupt the whole scan if one URL fails.** If `browser_navigate` errors (timeout, 403, etc.), mark as `skipped_expired` and continue.

10. **For each verified new offer passing filters**:
    a. Add to `pipeline.md` Pending section: `- [ ] {url} | {company} | {title}`
    b. Register in `scan-history.tsv`: `{url}\t{date}\t{query_name}\t{title}\t{company}\tadded`

11. **Offers filtered by title**: register in `scan-history.tsv` with status `skipped_title`
12. **Duplicate offers**: register with status `skipped_dup`
13. **Expired offers (Level 3)**: register with status `skipped_expired`

## Extracting Title and Company from WebSearch Results

WebSearch results come in formats like: `"Job Title @ Company"` or `"Job Title | Company"` or `"Job Title — Company"`.

Extraction patterns by portal:
- **Ashby**: `"Senior AI PM (Remote) @ EverAI"` → title: `Senior AI PM`, company: `EverAI`
- **Greenhouse**: `"AI Engineer at Anthropic"` → title: `AI Engineer`, company: `Anthropic`
- **Lever**: `"Product Manager - AI @ Temporal"` → title: `Product Manager - AI`, company: `Temporal`

Generic regex: `(.+?)(?:\s*[@|—–-]\s*|\s+at\s+)(.+?)$`

## Private URLs

If a non-publicly accessible URL is found:
1. Save the JD to `jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md`
2. Add to pipeline.md as: `- [ ] local:jds/{company}-{role-slug}.md | {company} | {title}`

## Scan History

`data/scan-history.tsv` tracks ALL seen URLs:

```
url	first_seen	portal	title	company	status
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	PM AI	Acme	added
https://...	2026-02-10	Greenhouse — SA	Junior Dev	BigCo	skipped_title
https://...	2026-02-10	Ashby — AI PM	SA AI	OldCo	skipped_dup
https://...	2026-02-10	WebSearch — AI PM	PM AI	ClosedCo	skipped_expired
```

## Output Summary

```
Portal Scan — {YYYY-MM-DD}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Queries executed: N
Offers found: N total
Filtered by title: N relevant
Duplicates: N (already evaluated or in pipeline)
Expired discarded: N (dead links, Level 3)
Added to pipeline.md: N

  + {company} | {title} | {query_name}
  ...

→ Run /career-ops pipeline to evaluate new offers.
```

## Careers URL Management

Every company in `tracked_companies` should have a `careers_url` — the direct link to their job page. This avoids searching it every time.

**Known patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/{slug}`
- **Greenhouse:** `https://job-boards.greenhouse.io/{slug}` or `https://job-boards.eu.greenhouse.io/{slug}`
- **Lever:** `https://jobs.lever.co/{slug}`
- **BambooHR:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail`
- **Teamtailor:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs`
- **Workday:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/{site}`
- **Custom:** The company's own URL (e.g., `https://openai.com/careers`)

**API/Feed patterns by platform:**
- **Ashby API:** `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/api/non-user-graphql?op=ApiJobBoardWithTeams`
- **BambooHR API:** list `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/list`; detail `https://{company}.bamboohr.com/careers/{id}/detail` (`result.jobOpening`)
- **Lever API:** `https://api.lever.co/v0/postings/{company}?mode=json`
- **Teamtailor RSS:** `https://{company}.teamtailor.com/jobs.rss`
- **Workday API:** `https://{company}.{shard}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/{company}/{site}/jobs`

**If a `careers_url` does not exist** for a company:
1. Try its known platform pattern
2. If it fails, do a quick WebSearch: `"{company}" careers jobs`
3. Navigate with Playwright to confirm it works
4. **Save the found URL in portals.yml** for future scans

**If `careers_url` returns 404 or redirect:**
1. Note in output summary
2. Try scan_query as fallback
3. Mark for manual update

## Maintenance of portals.yml

- **ALWAYS save `careers_url`** when adding a new company
- Add new queries as interesting portals or roles are discovered
- Disable queries with `enabled: false` if they generate too much noise
- Adjust filtering keywords as target roles evolve
- Add companies to `tracked_companies` when you want to follow them closely
- Periodically verify `careers_url` — companies change ATS platforms
